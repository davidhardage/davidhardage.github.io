## Dating

I haven't written anything in a while. When I was thinking about that, I started thinking about why. That's when I realized it was because I've been doing some dating. Since [my last post]({% post_url A-Century-of-Horror %}), almost 3 months ago, I have - shall we say - spent a lot of my time with a couple of specific people. 

But as happens in dating, those relationships have either ended or fizzled out or not gone the way I was hoping or whatever else happens in dating. Which happens! I am not here to write about that. What I'm here to get out is this complicated loop I've found myself thinking. It goes something like this:

### The Loop
 
1. I'm bored and everything I want to do is more fun with a partner in crime (this is especially big because I am an introvert who has much higher tolerance for time at home than most people and I don't regularly feel the actual *urge* to go out)
2. I should go do something and maybe try to talk to some people
3. Ugh being social sucks, whoever I date should be a homebody
4. Wait, I'm wanting to date someone who is kind of basically me so that I can justify spending staying home
5. ...Should I even be dating then?

It's something like that, where I cycle through a couple of things that I feel to be contradictory. In other words, I question my own motives and hit the polar opposites of dating from I-want-a-serious-relationship to be-single-forever.

I have no grand reveal or pearl of wisdom to offer. I know that dating isn't easy and that half the fun is the experiences you have along the way. I'm just impatient, unsure of what the correct path is (I'm convinced that there is no correct path), and mostly venting. Put simply, I'm just a mid-20s dude tryna date.

_And since I'm a fan of meta-analysis, I find it interesting to observe my own train of thought as I write this post. Because I assume that whoever I end up dating will probably be curious enough to open my blog, she'll see a post with "Dating" in the title and, well, here they/you are._

## Other Stuff, Kind Of

Another update, I guess, is about my little project I'm calling [A Century of Horror]({% post_url A-Century-of-Horror %}) (also my last post). I have made no progress on it. There's a bit of a dating tie-in with that, in that I wanted to watch the silent films with someone. A larger factor, though, is that my movie watching and particularly my horror viewership has really decreased. Instead, my media time has gone towards shows, which I do not track. I will say I have particularly enjoyed Scrubs and House, so much so that other shows cannot seem to hold my attention. I think this is the subject for my next post so I'll leave it here for now.

I'm going to Japan two weeks from tomorrow. I'm nervous about it, but of course I am also excited. It's my first solo trip since June 2017, which means I'll have almost a week of getting in tune with myself and challenging myself. After that, I should be going to Norway and Jordan. More about that later, if at all.
